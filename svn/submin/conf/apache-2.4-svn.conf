# This config file was automatically created with submin2-admin. If you use
# this command again, it will overwrite all changes to this file. The
# recommanded way to regenerate this file is to change the config with
# submin2-admin and run:
#
#   submin2-admin /var/lib/submin apacheconf create all 
#
#
# To make this config active, you have to include it in your apache
# config. The recommended way is to include it in one of your virtual hosts:
#
# <Virtualhost *:80>
#     <other configuration>
#
#     Include <path to this file>
# </VirtualHost>
#
# This configuration file is for Apache >= 2.4

#
# WARNING: Please be aware that some distributions have default
# configuration for subversion (mod_dav_svn/mod_authz_svn) that might
# conflict with submin's configuration. For example. CentOS has a
# configuration file in /etc/httpd/conf.d/subversion.conf that conflicts
# with Submin's configuration.
#
# Please DISABLE your distribution's default subversion configuration!
